Courage by Ben & Ben

I wanna see the world
I wanna see the world through your eyes
I've been so blinded by the painful reality of life
I'm so tired, am I a slave to my anxiety?
When will I finally be free? Will I find my release?
I hear your voice whispering to me

All your struggles will be worth it
In the end, keep carrying on with courage
Your breakthrough is arriving
Until then, keep carrying on with courage

Keep carrying on, keep carrying
Keep carrying on

Don't be scared, what have you got to lose?
Haven't you heard the news? The war's been won for us
Be prepared, the miracles for you
Are far greater than the trials you've surpassed
Keep going, my friend, keep going

All your struggles will be worth it
In the end, keep carrying on with courage
Your breakthrough is arriving
Until then, keep carrying on with courage

Keep carrying on, keep carrying
Keep carrying on with courage
Keep carrying on, keep carrying
Keep carrying on with courage

When the weight of your burdens
Makes it seem like your world's ending
It's okay to feel overwhelmed
But don't keep up, just keep going

Faith can quiet the worst fear
Coldest winters turn into spring
Even darkness must disappear
So don't keep up, just keep going
Just keep going

Keep carrying on, keep carrying
Keep carrying on with courage
Keep carrying on, keep carrying
Keep carrying on with courage

All your struggles will be worth it
In the end, keep carrying on with courage
