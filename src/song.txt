Latin translation:

Mundum videre volo.
Mundum per oculos tuos videre volo.
Tam excaecatus sum a dolorosa vitae realitate.
Tam fessus sum, num servus sum anxietatis meae?
Quando tandem liber ero? Inveniamne liberationem meam?
Vocem tuam mihi susurrantem audio.

Omnes labores tui digni erunt.
Denique, perge cum fortitudine.
Perruptio tua adest.
Interim, perge cum fortitudine.

Perge, perge.

Perge.

Noli timere, quid tibi perdendum est?
Nonne nuntium audivisti? Bellum nobis victum est.
Esto paratus, miracula tibi
Multo maiora sunt quam tribulationes quas superasti.
Perge, amice mi, perge.

Omnes labores tui operam ferent.
Denique, perge cum fortitudine.
Perruptio tua advenit.
Interim, perge cum fortitudine.

Perge, perge cum fortitudine.

Perge, perge cum fortitudine.
Perge, perge cum fortitudine.
Perge cum fortitudine.

Cum pondus onerum tuorum
Finem mundi tui videri facit.
Licet te obrui sentire.
Sed noli perseverare, perge modo.

Fides pessimum metum sedare potest.
Hiemes frigidissimae in ver vertuntur.
Etiam tenebrae evanescere debent.
Ergo noli perseverare, perge modo.
Perge modo.

Perge, perge perseverare.
Perge cum fortitudine.
Perge, perge perseverare.
Perge cum fortitudine.

Omnes labores tui operam ferent.
Denique, perge cum fortitudine.
